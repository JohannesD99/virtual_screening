Script for docking multiple ligands using Autodock Vina.  
It was made on a maschine running Windows 10 and Python 3.7.1

There are two main functionalities:

1) Dowload, unzip and preprocess the ligands from a Zinc15-downloadfile,  
   containing urls to the tranches and the respective .pdbqt files
   
2) Docking those extracted molecules, while only keeping the highest scoring results


I am not considering myself an experienced programmer yet.   
So please excuse that some lines might be unconventional but at least it worked for me.
